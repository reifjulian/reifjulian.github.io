	"abstract": "Many environmental hazards have long-run health effects, but quasi-experimental studies typically measure outcomes and treatment over short time periods. We develop a new framework for quantifying the effect of air pollution exposure on life expectancy. Using daily changes in wind direction as an instrument for air pollution, we first characterize the dynamic mortality effects of short-run exposure. We then incorporate these estimates into a demographic model to quantify the lifelong effects of a permanent reduction in air pollution exposure. Ninety percent of the survival benefits accrue after the first fifty years of life."

	"abstract": "We study how access to credit markets affects the value of insurance. Loans allow consumers to smooth financial shocks over time, reducing the incremental benefits provided by insurance. We derive tractable formulas for the value of insurance that can be taken to data and show how that value varies with loan features. We then apply our framework to health insurance.  Access to a five-year loan decreases the values of community- and experience-rated health insurance for the average two-person household by $232-$366 (58-61%). Even for the sickest decile, loan access reduces the value of community-rated insurance by $1,099 (17%). Our results suggest that greater credit availability can serve as a substitute for health insurance."

	"abstract": "We study habit formation in annual biometric health screenings using a field experiment that randomly assigned financial incentives to 4,799 employees over three years. We document evidence of strong habit formation from initial exposure: completing the first screening raised subsequent screening rates by 32.4-36.0 percentage points (84%-90%) in the second and third years, with no evidence of decay. In contrast, completing the second screening had a minimal effect on screenings in the third year. This pattern contradicts an addiction mechanism, which predicts a stronger relationship for behaviors closer in time, and instead supports an experience-good model where consumers learn the value of screening through first exposure."

	"abstract": "One in seven Americans carry medical debt, with $69 billion reported on consumer credit reports. In April 2023, the three major credit bureaus stopped reporting medical debt collections below $500. We study the effects of this information deletion on consumer credit scores, credit access, repayment behavior, and payday borrowing. Regression discontinuity estimates comparing individuals just above and below the $500 threshold show that the deletion reduced the reported number of medical debt collections by 61 percent. Despite expectations that removing negative credit information would improve credit outcomes for affected individuals, we find no evidence of benefits over the subsequent two years, ruling out even small effects. To interpret these findings, we build credit scoring models and show that medical debts, regardless of size, add minimal incremental information for default prediction beyond standard credit report variables, implying that they contribute negligibly to credit risk assessment. Our results suggest that eliminating medical debt collections entirely from credit reports would be unlikely to affect credit outcomes."

	"abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant direct and indirect excess mortality among the US population, impacting the future outlays of the US Social Security Administration (SSA) Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. This study aimed to estimate the net effects of pandemic-induced excess deaths on OASDI liabilities, utilizing dynamic microsimulation models, and examined how these effects vary across different socioeconomic and racial-ethnic groups. Data on excess deaths were obtained from the CDC and processed to account for seasonal variations and demographic disparities. The simulation incorporated demographic and health status variables to project OASDI retirement and disability benefits, and survivors’ benefits for spouses and children, for respondents with highest COVID mortality risk. The pandemic resulted in approximately 1.4 million excess deaths among individuals aged 25 and older between 2020 and 2023. These premature deaths mostly reduced future retirement benefits, which increased the Social Security fund by $219 billion. Future disability benefit payments were reduced by $6 billion. However, these gains were partly offset by reductions in future payroll tax flows ($44 billion) and increased payments to surviving spouses and children ($25 billion), resulting in a net impact of $156 billion. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic decedents left behind more underage children per capita, yet payments to their surviving family members were lower compared to non-Hispanic White decedents, across all educational levels. Excess mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic has complex implications for the OASDI program. While there is an estimated net positive financial impact due to reduced future retirement benefits, this effect is mitigated by decreased payroll tax contributions and increased survivors’ benefits. The differential impact by race and ethnicity highlights existing inequalities and underscores the importance of considering demographic disparities in future projections of Social Security liabilities. These findings provide critical insights for informing SSA trust fund projections and policy decisions."
